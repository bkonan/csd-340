        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. My childhood was filled with outdoor adventures, and I cherish those memories deeply. <span class="sentence">The sense of community was strong, and it shaped who I am today.</span></p>
        <p>I have always been passionate about technology. From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and how they worked. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in software development.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books, hiking, and exploring new places. These hobbies allow me to unwind and find inspiration in the world around me.</p>
        <p>My family has been a great support system throughout my journey. They have encouraged me to follow my dreams and continue learning and growing in my field.</p>
